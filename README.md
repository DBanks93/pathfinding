# Pathfinding Simulation
 This is a program that will show off some the types of pathfinding algorithms

- You can see how many nodes the algorithm has visited as well as the distance 
- Time taken for the algorithm to complete is also shown (with it not being effected by the speed slider)
At the moment it's WIP but feel free to check out some algorithms implemented so far!!

Current Algorithms:
- Depth First Search (DFS)
- Breath First Search (BFS)
- Dijkstra's 
- A Star

You can add blocked tiles by holding shift and hovering mouse over tiles

**Requirements:**
-
- Java 8 (or higher)  {I used Java 17 on my Machine}
- JavaFx
