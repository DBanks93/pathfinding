# Pathfinding Simulation
 This is a program that will show off some the types of pathfinding algorithms

At the moment it's WIP but feel free to check out some algorithms implemented so far!!

Current Algorithms:
- Depth First Search (DFS)
- Breath First Search (BFS)
- Dijkstra's 
- A Star

You can add blocked tiles by holding shift and hovering mouse over tiles

**Requirements:**
-
- Java 8 (or higher)  {I used Java 17 on my Machine}
- JavaFx
